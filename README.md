You will also find my [.gitconfig](https://github.com/jelek21/Coding_Tools/blob/master/.gitconfig) file that is located in your /home/username folder under Linux.

For coding tools and Tips, there is a cool document in [scrassmussen/tools](https://github.com/scrasmussen/tools) repository.
go check it out it is really well written and there are some cool tips and tools for programming.

For documentation, I actually use [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/).

I often use Linux to work, even if i am locked on a windows computer, since Win10, there is the [Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) that allows you to run a Bash terminal under Windows 10.

As I often use the WSL and powershell, I installed [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) on my coputers, it is a light tool allowing you to emulate a terminal with the specifications an personnalisation you want to have, it is a light and simple to use tool and it changes your life.

### Some Daily tools

  * [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/?lang=fr) A very usefull tool allowing to compare two files and to merge those files.
  * [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) An FTP tool supporting SFTP(FTP under SSH) in its cool features it can collect sessions saved under PuTTy.
  * [PuTTy](https://www.putty.org/) A very complete SSH client for windows, it also support Serial communication, Telnet, rlogin and TCP.
  * [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) A cool tool, it can read avery text file containing column of datas and plot it into a very clean graph, it needs a bit of work to learn how to use it but [here](https://people.duke.edu/~hpgavin/gnuplot.html) is a cool tutorial.
