For coding tools and Tips, there is a cool document in [scrassmussen/tools](https://github.com/scrasmussen/tools) repository.
go check it out it is really well written and there are some cool tips and tools for programming.

For documentation, I actually use [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/).

I often use Linux to work, even if i am locked on a windows computer, since Win10, there is the [Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) that allows you to run a Bash terminal under Windows 10.

As I often use the WSL and powershell, I installed [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) on my coputers, it is a light tool allowing you to emulate a terminal with the specifications an personnalisation you want to have, it is a light and simple to use tool and it changes your life.
